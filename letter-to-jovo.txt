Hi Josh,

My name is Devin, I'm Alex's friend / learning buddy. I think he mentioned I'd be contacting you - I've heard a lot about you and the stuff you guys are doing looks super cool.

I'm a physics major looking for computer science-y work and I have a lot of background quantitative skills. I also know some things about neuroscience from Alex (I taught him a bunch of things about physics in return). I did great and learned a ton as an undergrad, and I've been teaching myself a bunch of cool stuff since I graduated. Check out my github here: https://github.com/DevinCrowley

I don't have a ton of work experience, but I know a lot of things about math, some things about computer science, and I'm great at learning.

It would be great to talk sometime if you're free!

Thanks,

Devin Crowley
